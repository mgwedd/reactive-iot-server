# Reactive IoT Server

## Scripts

Start the app: `npm start`

Start nodemon for the app: `npm run dev`

Run tests: `npm test`

Run debugger: `npm debug`

## Deploying

When the new project is ready for deployment, add a new Heroku app with `heroku create`. This will make a new git remote called "heroku". Then `npm run deploy`, which will push to this remote's master branch after auditing your packages (a predeploy script).
